Challenge taken from `frontendmentor.io`, resources can be found in [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH)

I've developed this solution using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

To run it, just do an `npm install` on the root, and then `npm start`.
